## Description & History

<blockquote style="text-align: center;"><i>"Before everything, there was nothing, that nothing was the only one thing, and that was everything, and everyone."</i></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Khieyr, the god of Creation was the creator of all things we know, life, death, even the other gods. He started the universe and the planet we live in. He created humanoid species, he created other gods, his children, and proceeded to make an ecosystem that everyone could live in one and harmony.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; One day one of his childs, Rhedos, God of War, started an uprise via his followers.An Empire, Asturia Dynasty, of which his influence was strong upon, started a conquest against all the continent.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Rhedos' brother, Zuarus, God of Law, stood against him and tried to gather all his sisters and brothers against Rhedos.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; The war on the earth was so heated up that, all Khieyr's children forgot their reason why they were fighting, and this fight the cause of which was to stop Rhedos from conquesting all of the land of Eopihuan turned into a war to dominate all the other gods and species.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Khieyr didn't like the act of greed from his children and didn't support any of them, because supporting one of them meant the death of all of his other creations.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; So Khieyr stood up and ordered his children to stop this nonsensetic act of war. But it was too late. The greed of power corrupted all his children.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;His children all turned their army against him, in order him to get out of the way. Khieyr realised that his children grow past him at this point and was outpowered. He and the remaining follower warriors of him stood in the Zuuhgan City, surrounded by the other gods and their followers. Him and his army was killed there.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; There was built a Crypt for him by his remaining few followers.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Currently he has no followers and his only remaniscent is in myths, he is practically a forgotten god.</div>
