## Description & History


<blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Muerte... It was God's frst creation, even before there was something to be "&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>taken away he was there doing his duty, what it was or how it is is still unknown&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>until this day. Today there's only one thing that we know about him and it is that&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>you'll eventually face IT. "&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>-Felix Arquitius&nbsp;</i></div></i></blockquote><div>The Grim Reaper, whose true name is unknown, was the frst human Khieyr 
</div><div>created, a mortal man who lived a long and fulflling life on his own, mostly 
</div><div>spending his time talking to the creator. He was like a prototype of humanity. 
</div><div>When he died, he was given a choice: move on to the afterlife or become a reaper 
</div><div>and guide the souls of the departed to their fnal resting place.
</div><div>He chose to become a reaper and was taken under the wing of Death itself, who 
</div><div>taught him the ways of the trade. At frst, he found the work to be fulflling - he 
</div><div>was helping souls fnd their way to their next life. But as the centuries passed, he 
</div><div>became increasingly despondent.
</div><div>He watched as humanity became more and more corrupt, and he carried the 
</div><div>souls of murderers, rapists, and other evil individuals to their fnal judgment. He 
</div><div>saw the pain and suffering of the families left behind and felt the weight of the 
</div><div>world on his shoulders.
</div><div>In the early days of his work as a Grim Reaper, the Reaper met a being named 
</div><div>Life. Life was a powerful force that gave life to every creation, from the smallest 
</div><div>insect to the largest mammal. The Reaper was fascinated by Life's ability to 
</div><div>create, but also understood that his own job was the natural balance to Life's 
</div><div>work.
</div><div>Over time, the two formed an unlikely bond. The Reaper would often watch as Life 
</div><div>created new creatures, marveling at the intricacy of the process. Life, in turn, 
</div><div>would ask the Reaper questions about his job, seeking to understand the nature 
</div><div>of death.
</div><div>As the centuries passed, their conversations became deeper and more personal. 
</div><div>The Reaper began to share his feelings of sadness and hopelessness, while Life 
</div><div>would listen with empathy and offer words of comfort. Though they were vastly 
</div><div>different beings, they found a common ground in their desire to help others.
</div><div>Despite the sadness that the Reaper carried with him, Life's presence brought a 
</div><div>sense of hope and wonder to his life. He knew that even though he was tasked 
</div><div>with carrying souls to their fnal judgment, Life's work ensured that new life would 
</div><div>always emerge. They were two sides of the same coin, each necessary for the 
</div><div>natural balance of the world.
</div><div>Though they were separated by their vastly different roles, the Reaper and Life 
</div><div>remained close friends throughout the ages. Even now, as the Reaper wanders 
</div><div>the earth alone, he fnds comfort in knowing that Life continues to give birth to 
</div><div>new creations and that he has a true friend in the world.</div>
